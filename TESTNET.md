# ADIC Testnet Validator Guide

Welcome to the ADIC testnet! This guide will help you set up and run a validator node on the ADIC test network.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)

Join the ADIC testnet as a validator with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IguanAI/adic-core/main/scripts/join-testnet-docker.sh | bash
```

This script will:
1. Check for Docker prerequisites
2. Clone and compile the ADIC node from source
3. Configure your node as a validator
4. Start your node with auto-updates enabled
5. Connect to the testnet via DNS seeds

## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements

**Minimum (Testnet)**:
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- 4GB RAM
- 2 CPU cores
- 20GB available disk space
- Stable internet connection
- Ports 8080, 9000, 9001 available

**Recommended**:
- 8GB RAM
- 4 CPU cores
- 50GB SSD storage
- Dedicated server or VPS
- Public IP address (for better connectivity)

### Required Ports

Make sure these ports are open in your firewall:
- `8080/tcp` - HTTP API
- `9000/tcp` - P2P communication
- `9001/udp` - QUIC protocol

## üîß Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IguanAI/adic-core.git
cd adic-core
```

### Step 2: Start with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml up -d
```

### Step 3: Verify Node is Running

```bash
# Check node health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml logs -f
```

## üéØ What is a Validator?

As a validator on the ADIC testnet, your node will:

- **Participate in Consensus**: Help validate and approve messages in the network
- **Maintain the Tangle**: Store and propagate messages across the network
- **Earn Test Tokens**: Receive test ADIC tokens for validation work (testnet only)
- **Support Network Security**: Contribute to the network's ultrametric security model
- **Auto-Update**: Automatically update to new versions (v0.1.7+)

### Validator Responsibilities

1. **Uptime**: Keep your validator online as much as possible
2. **Resources**: Ensure adequate CPU, memory, and bandwidth
3. **Security**: Keep your server secure and updated
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for issues and respond to alerts

## üìä Monitoring Your Validator

### Basic Health Checks

```bash
# Check if node is healthy
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Get node information
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/node/info | jq

# Check peer connections
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/network/peers | jq '.peers | length'

# View recent messages
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/messages/recent | jq
```

### Docker Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml logs -f

# Stop the node
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml down

# Restart the node
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml restart

# Update and restart
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml up -d
```

### Advanced Monitoring (Optional)

Enable Prometheus and Grafana monitoring:

```bash
# Start with monitoring stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml --profile monitoring up -d

# Access dashboards
# Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
# Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (user: admin, password: admin)
```

## üîÑ Auto-Updates

Your testnet node is configured with auto-updates enabled by default. The node will:

1. Check for updates via DNS at `_version.adic.network.adicl1.com`
2. Download new versions from peers when available
3. Verify cryptographic signatures
4. Perform safe hot-reload without losing state

To disable auto-updates, edit `testnet-config.toml`:
```toml
[network]
auto_update = false  # Set to false to disable
```

## üåê Network Configuration

Your validator connects to the testnet through:

- **DNS Seeds**: Automatic peer discovery via `_seeds.adicl1.com`
- **Bootstrap Peers**: Initial nodes to connect to (discovered via DNS)
- **P2P Network**: Gossip protocol for message propagation
- **QUIC Transport**: Fast, reliable communication protocol

### Configuration File

The main configuration is in `testnet-config.toml`:

```toml
[node]
validator = true  # Run as validator
data_dir = "./data/testnet"

[network]
dns_seeds = ["_seeds.adicl1.com"]
auto_update = true
max_peers = 50

[consensus]
# Testnet parameters
r_sum_min = 2.0  # Lower threshold for testnet
r_min = 0.5      # Lower threshold for testnet
deposit = 0.1    # Test ADIC deposit amount
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Node Won't Start

1. Check Docker is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml logs --tail 50
   ```

3. Ensure ports are available:
   ```bash
   netstat -tulpn | grep -E '8080|9000|9001'
   ```

### No Peers Connected

1. Check DNS resolution:
   ```bash
   dig TXT _seeds.adicl1.com
   ```

2. Check firewall allows outbound connections

3. Verify network configuration:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/network/status
   ```

### High Memory Usage

The RocksDB backend may use available memory for caching. To limit usage, adjust in `testnet-config.toml`:

```toml
[storage]
cache_size = 67108864  # 64MB cache (reduce if needed)
```

### Build Failures

If Docker build fails:

1. Ensure you have enough disk space
2. Try with more memory: `docker-compose --compatibility up`
3. Clean and rebuild:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml down -v
   docker system prune -a
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml up -d --build
   ```

3. Join our community channels (coming soon)
4. Open a new issue with:
   - Your setup details (OS, Docker version)
   - Error messages from logs
   - Steps to reproduce the issue

## üîê Security Considerations

While this is a testnet:

1. **Don't use production keys**: This is a test network
2. **Keep Docker updated**: Regular security updates are important
3. **Monitor your node**: Watch for unusual behavior
4. **Report issues**: Help us identify and fix problems

## üéâ Next Steps

Once your validator is running:

1. **Monitor Performance**: Use the API endpoints to track your node's performance
2. **Stay Updated**: Watch for announcements about testnet events
3. **Provide Feedback**: Report bugs and suggest improvements
4. **Experiment**: Try sending messages, exploring the API, and testing features
