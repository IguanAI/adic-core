# ADIC Core Integration Fixes

## Summary of Fixed Issues

Based on the analysis in DESIGN.md, the following integration issues were identified and fixed:

### ✅ 1. MRW Integration in Node

**Issue**: Node called non-existent MRW APIs
- `TipManager::get_all_tips()` → Fixed to use existing `get_tips()`
- Missing `MrwEngine::select_parents()` wrapper

**Fix**:
- Updated `crates/adic-node/src/node.rs` to use `tip_manager.get_tips().await`
- Added `select_parents()` method to `MrwEngine` in `crates/adic-mrw/src/lib.rs`
- Method builds `ParentCandidate` structures from tip IDs with features, reputation, and conflict penalties

### ✅ 2. Admissibility Enforcement (C1 vs S≥d)

**Issue**: Code enforced strict per-parent C1 instead of score function S(x;A) ≥ d from whitepaper

**Fix**:
- Updated `crates/adic-consensus/src/admissibility.rs`
- Replaced C1 checking with `calculate_score()` function that implements S(x;A)
- Score function: `Σ(trust(parent_reputation) * Σ(axis_scores))` where axis_scores = 1 if vp_diff ≥ radius
- Trust function: `ln(1 + reputation)` as specified in paper

### ✅ 3. Message Signing

**Issue**: Node didn't sign messages before validation, causing all messages to fail signature check

**Fix**:
- Added `to_bytes()` method to `AdicMessage` in `crates/adic-types/src/message.rs`
- Updated node and CLI to sign messages with `keypair.sign(&message.to_bytes())` before validation
- Ensures `MessageValidator` can verify signatures properly

### ✅ 4. Finality/Consensus Interfaces  

**Issue**: `FinalityEngine` called non-existent getter methods on consensus
- `consensus.deposits()` → should be `consensus.deposits` (field access)
- `consensus.reputation()` → should be `consensus.reputation` (field access)

**Fix**:
- Updated `crates/adic-finality/src/engine.rs` to use field access
- Fixed `FinalityEngine::clone()` by adding `#[derive(Clone)]` to `KCoreAnalyzer`

### ✅ 5. Gamma Parameter

**Issue**: `ConsensusEngine::new()` used `shared_params.gamma` but `AdicParams` had no gamma field

**Fix**:
- Added `gamma: f64` field to `AdicParams` in `crates/adic-types/src/lib.rs`
- Set default value `gamma: 0.9` for reputation update factor (0 < γ < 1)

### ✅ 6. Tip Removal Logic

**Issue**: Node removed all original tips instead of only selected parents

**Fix**:
- Updated `crates/adic-node/src/node.rs` to remove only `&parents` from tip manager
- Changed from `for parent_id in &tips` to `for parent_id in &parents`

### ✅ 7. CLI Test Path Updates

**Issue**: CLI test used outdated flow without MRW selection, signing, escrow/validation

**Fix**:
- Updated `crates/adic-node/src/cli.rs` to use complete integrated flow:
  - MRW parent selection via `mrw.select_parents()`
  - Message signing before validation
  - Deposit escrow via `consensus.deposits.escrow()`
  - Validation and slashing via `consensus.validate_and_slash()`
  - Proper tip management with add/remove operations

## Result

All integration issues identified in the design review have been resolved:

- **Node/MRW integration**: ✅ Complete with ParentCandidate building and proper parent selection
- **Admissibility enforcement**: ✅ Uses score function S(x;A) ≥ d instead of strict C1  
- **Message signing**: ✅ All messages properly signed before validation
- **Interface consistency**: ✅ Field access patterns fixed between finality and consensus engines
- **Parameter completeness**: ✅ All required parameters (including gamma) now present
- **Logic correctness**: ✅ Tip management and test paths aligned with production code

The ADIC Core implementation now has properly wired components that follow the mathematical specifications in the whitepaper.

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run integration tests  
cargo test --all

# Run CLI test with integrated flow
./target/release/adic test --count 50

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

All components should now work together cohesively according to the p-adic DAG protocol specification.
