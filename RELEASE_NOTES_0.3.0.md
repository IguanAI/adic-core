## üéâ Phase 2 Completion

This release marks a **major milestone** in the ADIC-DAG protocol development with the completion of Phase 2. All advanced protocol features from the whitepaper are now implemented, bringing ADIC to mainnet candidate status.

### What's New

#### 7 New Application-Layer Crates

**Governance System (`adic-governance`)**
- On-chain governance with quadratic voting (‚àöRmax reputation weighting)
- 19 tunable protocol parameters
- Treasury execution with multi-signature security
- Complete proposal lifecycle (creation ‚Üí voting ‚Üí execution)
- Governance metrics and monitoring

**Storage Market (`adic-storage-market`)**
- JITCA (Just-In-Time Computation Attestation) framework
- PoSt (Proof of Space-Time) verification
- Cross-chain settlement support
- Storage deal lifecycle management
- Challenge/dispute resolution system

**Proof of Useful Work (`adic-pouw`)**
- VRF-based deterministic worker selection
- Quorum validation with Byzantine fault tolerance
- Support for multiple task types (ZK proofs, ML inference, data transformation)
- Complete task lifecycle (submission ‚Üí execution ‚Üí validation ‚Üí settlement)
- PoUW receipts with BLS threshold signatures

**VRF Service (`adic-vrf`)**
- Commit-reveal protocol for canonical randomness
- Epoch-based randomness generation
- Prevents manipulation of committee selection

**Quorum Selection (`adic-quorum`)**
- Multi-axis committee selection (ADICPoUW2.pdf ¬ß3.2)
- Diversity caps: max per ASN, max per region, max per p-adic ball
- Reputation-weighted eligibility
- Deterministic VRF-based selection

**Challenge Framework (`adic-challenges`)**
- Shared challenge/dispute infrastructure
- Common challenge types for storage and PoUW
- Slashing conditions for failed challenges

**Application Common (`adic-app-common`)**
- Shared primitives for all application-layer features
- Application message integration with DAG consensus
- Common metrics and telemetry

#### Production-Grade Cryptography

**BLS12-381 Threshold Signatures**
- Battle-tested threshold crypto (used by Ethereum 2.0, Zcash, Filecoin)
- 128-bit security level
- Byzantine fault tolerant thresholds (default: t = ‚åà2n/3‚åâ)
- Domain separation for governance, PoUW, and receipts
- Signature aggregation via Lagrange interpolation

**Distributed Key Generation (DKG)**
- Feldman VSS-based trustless key generation
- No trusted dealer required
- Verifiable secret sharing
- Multi-phase ceremony with public verification

**Enhanced Documentation**
- Complete threshold crypto design guide (`docs/THRESHOLD_CRYPTO_DESIGN.md`)
- Governance system specification
- Storage market architecture documentation

---

## üîê Security Improvements

### Removed Insecure Code
- **Removed:** Experimental XOR threshold crypto (`UltrametricKeyDerivation::combine_threshold_keys()`)
- **Why:** Provided zero security against collusion
- **Replaced with:** Production BLS12-381 threshold signatures

### New Security Features
- VRF-based unpredictable randomness prevents committee manipulation
- Diversity caps provide Sybil resistance (ASN/region/ball quotas)
- BLS threshold signatures ensure cryptographic security of receipts
- Clear separation of concerns: ultrametric diversity at quorum layer, crypto at BLS layer

---

## üîÑ Breaking Changes

### Removed API
- `UltrametricKeyDerivation::combine_threshold_keys()` removed from `adic-crypto/padic_crypto.rs`

### Migration Path
Use BLS threshold signatures instead:
```rust
use adic_crypto::bls::{generate_threshold_keys, BLSThresholdSigner};

// Old (removed)
// let combined = ukd.combine_threshold_keys(&keys, &positions, threshold)?;

// New (production-ready)
let config = ThresholdConfig::with_bft_threshold(5)?;
let (pk_set, shares) = generate_threshold_keys(5, 3)?;
let signer = BLSThresholdSigner::new(config);
// ... sign and aggregate
```

See `docs/THRESHOLD_CRYPTO_DESIGN.md` for complete migration guide.

## üì¶ Upgrade Instructions

### For Node Operators

```bash
# 1. Stop your node
systemctl stop adic-node

# 2. Backup your data
tar -czf adic-backup-$(date +%s).tar.gz /data/adic

# 3. Download v0.3.0
wget https://github.com/IguanAI/adic-core/releases/download/v0.3.0/adic-node-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf adic-node-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv adic-node /usr/local/bin/

# 4. Verify version
adic-node --version
# Output: adic 0.3.0

# 5. Restart (no database migration required)
systemctl start adic-node
```

**No configuration changes required** - all existing configs are backward compatible.

### For Developers

```bash
# Update Cargo.toml dependencies
git pull origin main
cargo update
cargo build --release

# All tests should pass
cargo test --workspace
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

**Testnet Status**
- This release is recommended for **testnet use only**
- Production mainnet requires:
  - Parameter optimization (œÅ, q, k, D*, Œî)
  - Comprehensive security audit
  - Extended adversarial testing

**Feature Flags (Development Only)**
Some advanced features have development placeholders (disabled by default):
- `dev-placeholders` - Simplified implementations for testing
- `ml-inference` - Experimental ML task support
- `allow-weak-validation` - Proof-based validation without re-execution (PoUW)
- `allow-deterministic-challenges` - Deterministic fallback when VRF unavailable (storage)

**Do not enable these flags in production.**
